> A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you
> didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.
-- Leslie Lamport, 1987.

Distributed systems are the workhorses of modern day computing.
Applications ranging from home automation systems to e-commerce,
payment gateways, and cryptocurrencies all rely on distributed systems
to meet their computational needs and scale to millions of users
across the planet. Unfortunately though, the ubiquity of distributed
computing hasn't resulted in a proportional decrease in the complexity
of distributed programming; building reliable and scalable distributed
systems/applications remains hard despite decades of progress in this
direction. In this seminar course, we shall review the fundamental
challenges inherent in building provably-correct distributed
systems, discuss recent advances addressing or circumventing the
challenges, and explore ways to extend the state-of-the-art in
Distributed Program Verification.

As conveyed by the title, our emphasis in this course will be on the
specification and verification of distributed systems and
applications. Formal verification often invokes unfortunate connotations
of impracticality. We shall try to avoid this pitfall by prioritizing the study of theories, techniques, and systems with
strong practical implications. The course is **research-oriented**
meaning that there will be student-led discussions on
research papers and industry tech reports. It will be **hands-on**
meaning that there will be programming assignments (most likely in TLA+
and PlusCal) and a course project (to be proposed independently by
each student). To set a common ground for subsequent research
discussions, I will review the fundamental concepts of Distributed
Systems and Program Verification in the first few lectures. The
schedule can be found [here](../schedule).
